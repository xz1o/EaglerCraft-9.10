# Servers

Go to this doc (had to use the wayback machine) to get a list of Multiplayer Server Adresses. I do not own it or edit it in any way.

# IMPORTANT!

When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 1–5 MINUTES! It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5–10 minutes. Keep in mind that this is an old version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be available.

Disclaimer: I do not own Eaglercraft, and I am not associated with it in any way, this is just a way for people to access it fullscreen on browser.
